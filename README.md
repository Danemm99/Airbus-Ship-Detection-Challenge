## Introduction

Semantic segmentation is a computer vision task that involves classifying each pixel in an image into a specific category. In this repository, we use the UNet architecture to perform semantic segmentation for ship detection in aerial images.

## Files

- `data_augmentation.py`: This file defines an image augmentation module for data preprocessing.
- `data_processing`: First overview of the data.
- `dataset.py`: This file defines an AirbusDataset class, which serves as a PyTorch dataset for handling ship detection data.
- `losses.py`: This file implements several loss functions for image segmentation task.
- `metrics.py`: This file defines a set of functions and a class for computing evaluation metrics.
- `models.py`: This file defines two convolutional neural network (CNN) architectures. The architectures are named "Improved U-Net (IUNet)" and "Original U-Net".
- `submission.py`: Create 'submission.csv' file.
- `utils.py`: This file contains utility functions and configurations essential for ship detection in satellite images.
- `exploratory_data_analysys.ipynb`: This notebook focuses on the exploratory data analysis (EDA) aspect of a semantic segmentation task using the U-Net architecture.
- `train.py`: Python script for training the UNet model.
- `inference.py`: Python script for performing inference with the trained model.
- `pytorch-eda-unet-from-scratch-finetuning.ipynb`: Ð¡ombined files mentioned above in one Jupyter notebook. It contains the same code, just in one notebook. `You can use this notebook for testing my solution too (run on Kaggle platform)`.
- `submission.csv`: CSV file containing the inference results for submission.


## Requirements

Make sure to install the necessary dependencies before running the code. You can use the provided `requirements` file:

```
pip install -r requirements
```


## Results

Check the `submission.csv` file for the model's inference results. The result we got from `submission.py` notebook, is the main solution for the task.
